## REACT - Create React App
Create React App (CRA) is a tool developed by Facebook that helps you quickly set up a new React project with no configuration needed. It includes a pre-configured build process, development server, and a set of pre-installed dependencies that allow you to start building a new React application immediately. CRA abstracts away the complexity of configuring a new React project, and provides a standardized starting point that can be customized to fit your needs.
